## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repository via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). Make sure that you search for existing ones before attempting to create your own. If you found one that is similar to what you wanted to create, feel free to upvote it!

### Issues

The "Issues" section serves as a platform for you to share your suggestions or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement, feel free to create a new issue. Make sure that you provide a clear and concise description of the feature or enhancement you have in mind. If it's a bug, make sure that you include step by step instructions on how to reproduce it.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement added to the project! In general, pull requests should:

- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality.
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation wherever possible.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

In general, it's a good idea to start by opening an issue and discussing your proposal before diving into the actual work. This way, we can get everyone on board and avoid any accidental duplication of efforts. We follow this approach to keep things organized and make sure we're all on the same page.

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the project repository to your GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository that you can freely make changes to.

5. **Submit the Pull Request**: Go to the original project repository and locate the "Pull Requests" tab. Click on the "New Pull Request" button, and select your branch as the compare branch. Provide a descriptive title and a detailed description of your changes, making use of the provided template.
6. **Review and Address Feedback**: Your pull request will go through a review process. Be responsive to feedback and address any requested changes or comments promptly.
7. **Merge and Close**: Once your pull request has been approved, a project maintainer will merge it into the main codebase. Congratulations on your contribution! The pull request will then be closed.
